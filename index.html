          Tenvos AI is conducting a research study to explore how fatigue
          affects shift workers. Our goal is to develop technology that detects
          fatigue and enhances workplace safety.

        <h2>Who Can Participate?</h2>
        <p>
          If you work shifts longer than 8 hours, are located in Canada or the
          United States of America, and have a device with a camera and
          microphone (smartphone, tablet, or laptop), you might be eligible!
        </p>

              starting your shift.
            </li>
